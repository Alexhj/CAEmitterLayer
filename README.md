===================

Particle systems are *fun* visual candy to add to your apps. They are often used to create smoke, explosions, and fire effects in games.

They make great touches in productivity apps as well. Delicious Library, for example, famously consumes a book with a fire animation when you remove a book from your virtual bookshelf. Apple's animated "puff of smoke" image sequence - used to remove an application from the OS X dock - could be reimplemented more realistically as a particle system. You can also simulate a snow globe or confetti or â€¦ you-name-it. If many animated copies of a single particle / image can be used to create an effect, you can create the effect using a particle system.
